# ðŸ‘¥ Effective PR Review using Role Prompting

### AI Technique: Role Prompting
Role prompting directs an AI model to adopt a specific role or perspective when solving a task. By assigning the model a particular role (such as security expert, experienced developer, or technical writer), we receive more specialized and contextually relevant responses. This is especially useful when expertise in a specific domain is required or when multi-faceted analysis of a problem is needed.

### Task:
You've submitted code for review and received feedback that seems superficial. You need to use AI to get a deeper analysis of your code from different perspectives.

[Go](https://github.com/julia-dream/pr-review-using-role-prompting/blob/master/processUserData.go).

### Question:
What prompt using role instructions would you create to get a comprehensive analysis of this code from the perspective of different experts?

### Verification:
Compare your prompt with the expected answer:

#### Expected Role Prompt

```
Analyze the following JavaScript code from the perspective of three different experts:
As an experienced JavaScript developer, evaluate the code quality, efficiency, and adherence to modern JS standards.
As a security engineer, identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues in this code.
As a performance specialist, assess the code efficiency and suggest optimizations.
For each role, provide specific recommendations for improving the code in the respective aspect.

**Expected analysis results:**

**JavaScript Developer:**
- Usage of outdated var instead of let/const
- Application of modern array methods (map, filter) instead of for loops
- Use of template literals instead of concatenation
- Unnecessary use of ternary operator for boolean value

**Security Engineer:**
- Lack of user data validation
- Potential XSS vulnerabilities when processing user input
- Risks when saving unverified data to database

**Performance Specialist:**
- Inefficiency when working with large data arrays
- Multiple access to the same array elements
- Suggestions for using memoization or caching
